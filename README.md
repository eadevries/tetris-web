# Tetris Clone

## Tetris Built From Scratch with JavaScript and CSS

This clone of Tetris was built from scratch using only vanilla JavaScript and CSS. No frameworks were used.

Animations are created primarily by the addition or removal of CSS classes. The architecture was designed so that the game state and calculations are as independent as possible of the animations/screen updates.

## Features to be Added:

- Preview of next block
- Many improvements to page appearence and theme
- (Potentially) optional sound/music
